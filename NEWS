Changes in 1.01 (09 Apr 2000)

  * documentation updates
  * watcom/le: do not duplicate the non-resident name table

Changes in 0.82 (16 Aug 1999)
  * dos/exe: fixed a decompressor bug which could cause crash on some files
  * linux/i386: section headers are now stripped from the stub so that

Changes in 0.81 (04 Aug 1999)

    the DOS header
  * tmt/adam: added support for more stubs, detect already packed files
  * tmt/adam: new option `--copy-overlay'
  * wc/le: reduced memory requirement during uncompression

    results in a usual Windows message, importing a nonexistant function
    results in program exit (instead of crash ;-)
  * win32/pe: new option: `--compress-resources=0'
  * win32/pe: reduced memory requirement during uncompression, some
    files might even require LESS memory when they're compressed

  * win32/pe: improved relocation handling, 16-bit relocations should work
  * win32/pe: new option `--strip-relocs' (only if you know what you are doing)

  * important internal changes: now the stubs are built at runtime

    virus scanners now

Changes in 0.71 (19 Apr 1999)

Changes in 0.51 (14 Jan 1999)

    win32/pe executables from running under Windows NT and WINE
