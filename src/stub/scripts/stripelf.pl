# Strip section headers from the Linux stub. Section headers are
# optional for executables, but nevertheless binutils (2.9.1.0.25)
# complain with a "File format not recognized" error.
# Looks like a bug in binutils to me.
#
# A positive side effect of this is that `strip' cannot ruin an UPX
# compressed file any longer.
